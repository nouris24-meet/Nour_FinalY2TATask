# Nour_FinalY2TATask
The app is all of the minimum requirements + the bonuses of the Y2 Developers Track Task, I never learned React Native before this project, and honestly I'm really glad I got to do it. The app includes 5 pages including signup+login and a home page with just the logout button, and the to do list page where the user can add and delete tasks, and lastly the weather page where the user can input any city and it gives the weather info using OpenWeatherMap API. The user starts the app with signing up or logging in and then they can navigate through the pages freely:)
It runs normally like the instructions in the y2 task doc, I don't think I installed anythign extra other than for appwrite and the weather api which should be fine. 
I started Friday 27th at night with setting up and the nav bar and I continued with the rest the next day- Saturday 28th from 19:00 till midnight.
